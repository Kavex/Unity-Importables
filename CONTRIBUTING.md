# The rules!

- Download [this project](https://github.com/crabcrabcam/Unity-Importables-Project)
- Make a new folder in the Assets if you're making a new package
- go into the folder you wish to edit.
- Make the changes or additions
- Add the pull request to the other project not this one.
- If you're accepted I will accept that request over on the other project and download it. I'll then make the file and upload it. 
- You will need to add a txt with good instructions on what to do. In the style of this README.md

Thanks for all the help with this. If you want to change some spellings, just submit an issue to the other project. If you think this project differs to the other then make your issue here.
