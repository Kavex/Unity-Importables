# Platformer Movement
This package contains:
- Player Movement Script
- Ground block
- Player Object
- Setup of all the other things
- Everything else needed for the setup

What you need to do:
- Change the sprites.
  To do this you just need to put an image file in the Assets folder and select the "Player" object. Then you just need to drag the file to the "Sprite" section of the Player.
  This will change the image. You then repeat this for the ground blocks. 
- Create levels
  Use these building blocks to make levels. You'll be able to make something playable with only these items. To do multiple levels you'll need some more things from this repo. (Level Manager Kit)
